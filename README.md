# Codio Java Project Template
This starterpack serves as a template for Java projects in Codio.

## Open HelloWorld.java via file tree
Click on the HelloWorld.java file in the file tree to open it in the code editor.

You can right-click in the file tree to rename this file or delete it and start from a new file (see below).

## Compile, Run or Both
Use the Run button (that looks like a Rocketship) to Compile and Run the file your curser is in.

Use the drop-down arrow to the right of the "Compile & Run" option to change the button to just compile or just run.

## Reconfigure your Panels for easier development
Use the **View > Panels** menu on the top tool bar to segment your screen.

Simply drag the tab of the file or terminal (the part with the name) you want to move into the new panel.

## Make a new file
Use **File > New File...** or right-click in the file tree to create a new file.

As Codio detects which file is in focus, simply put your cursor into whichever code editor you want to compile and run.
